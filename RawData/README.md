# Getting raw data from the invoice PDF files
The raw data for this project is sourced from the online shopping invoices provided by the supermarket. This way there is no argument over data ownership, nor any need for special permission to access or reuse the data. While a connection to a public API supplied by the supermarkets would be preferable as a data source, the method used here is by far easier to obtain, even though it is more labour-intensive.

## Step 1: Preparing the folder structure
I keep my raw data files for this project in the **`~/grocery-reworking/`** folder on my local machine. The local git clone of this project is at **`~/git/grocery-reworking`** on my local machine. Note that the actual raw data files are kept out of the git repository entirely, for now.
```
~/grocery-reworking/RawData/pdf/
~/grocery-reworking/RawData/pdf/DONE/
~/grocery-reworking/RawData/txt/
~/grocery-reworking/RawData/txt/DONE/

~/git/grocery-reworking/
~/git/grocery-reworking/Code.gs
~/git/grocery-reworking/README.md
~/git/grocery-reworking/RawData/
~/git/grocery-reworking/RawData/README.md (this file)
~/git/grocery-reworking/SpreadsheetApp/   
```
## Step 2: Downloading the historic invoice PDF files
Each PDF file attachment should be downloaded individually from the emails sent by the supermarket when the transaction is completed. They should be named using the following format: **`yymmdd_nnnnnnnnnn.pdf`** where the `nnnnnnnnnn` is the invoice number. An example filename is `201215_4105566076.pdf`. Each one should be downloaded to the `~/grocery-reworking/RawData/pdf/` folder on the local machine.

## Step 3: Extracting text from the PDF files
For this step we will use the **`pdftotext`** command to extract the text from each PDF file, and save that text out as new text files in the **`~/grocery-reworking/RawData/txt/`** folder on the local machine.
```sh=
# cd ~/grocery-reworking/RawData/pdf/
# for file in *.pdf; do pdftotext "$file"; done
# mv *.txt ../txt/
```

> ðŸš€ *At this stage, the output files should look similar to* [*this DemoData file*](https://github.com/frittro/grocery-reworking/blob/f12d673f9c0b75c3e439ad18139952ee2bc84503/RawData/DemoData/150101__2224567890.txt).

## Step 4: Capturing relevant header and footer data
In the upcoming steps, we will be trimming our raw data files to remove the extraneous heading and footing lines, so that our raw data is focussed on the important parts of the information about the purchased products. Before we begin that trimming though, there is some important metadata that we want to be able to save from the heading and footing lines. We will be storing this metadata in the filenames for each file, so that it is kept external to the data, but still tied to the data sources.

Currently, our raw data text files are named with the pattern **`yymmdd_nnnnnnnnnn.txt`** which we established in Step 2 above. We are now going to change this to include another field, representing the supermarket chain and branch where each transaction occurred. As each branch is a business unit in its own right, they each will have their own GST registration number, which can be used as the primary key in the [t_Stores](https://github.com/frittro/grocery-reworking/blob/main/SpreadsheetApp/t_Stores) sheet. To make use of these GST registration numbers, we can run a simple one-line BASH script from within the **`~/grocery-reworking/RawData/txt/`** folder on the local machine.
```sh=
# for f in *_*.txt; do echo mv "$f" "${f%.txt}_$(sed '/.*GST: /!d; s///; q' "$f").txt"; done
```
This will produce a list of the necessary `mv` commands to process all of the text files in the folder. If you are satisfied with the output, then run the same script again, this time without the "`echo`" command.
```sh=
# for f in *_*.txt; do mv "$f" "${f%.txt}_$(sed '/.*GST: /!d; s///; q' "$f").txt"; done
```
Now check that all of the files have actually been renamed correctly. Our raw data text files should now be named with the pattern **`yymmdd_nnnnnnnnnn_iiiiiiiii.txt`**, where the new "`iiiiiiiii`" part should be the GST registration number of the supermarket branch which issued the invoice. If this is all correct, then we can move on to the next step.

## Step 5: Removing the invoice head and foot details
