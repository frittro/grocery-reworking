# grocery-reworking
This project was begun by [FrittRo](https://github.com/frittro) on 8-Aug-2022, with an [initial commit](https://github.com/frittro/grocery-reworking/commit/a1a7953c4f9dec1b11ca0fec15695522b36164c7) on 14-Aug-2022. The project is a complete reworking (a previous incarnation is [here](https://github.com/frittro/Grocery)) of our home grocery management system, using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. Even with the effort being put into this project, it is still only an interim solution itself. The ultimate goal for our home grocery management system is to migrate it to [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy). However, that is still a way off for us, so this project will suffice in the interim. Our Grocy implementation is on the backburner while we upskill with learning about [YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost) for self-hosting the Grocy server on a Raspberry Pi single board computer.

When we say "we" here, that means both [**FrittRo**](https://github.com/frittro) and **FrittNi**; an older, married couple living in West Auckland, New Zealand. However, the technical side of things is more FrittRo's department. FrittNi is not technically savvy at all. FrittRo however is a bit of a "computer geek", and is on the autism spectrum. Hence this project is being driven mainly by FrittRo, but with a desire eventually for FrittNi to find it useful for day-to-day tasks such as maintaining a simple shopping list, selecting weekly menu items, adding new recipes, etc.

We appreciate any help that we receive on this project, and we hope to give back to the community by making this codebase available publicly.

## Resources:
These are the master copies of the **grocery-reworking** project files. If it becomes necessary for any third parties to access these files, such as for the testing of proposed solutions to [Issues](https://github.com/frittro/grocery-reworking/issues), then a sanitized copy of these project files will be made available, containing demo data. Simply put, the codebase of this project is publicly available, but the underlying data isn't.
